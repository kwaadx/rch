# Upgrading RCH

RCH uses a single Docker image with an embedded database. Upgrades are simple: pull the new image and restart.

## Standard Upgrade

```bash
# 1. Create a backup (recommended)
docker exec rch /usr/local/bin/backup.sh

# 2. Pull the latest image
docker compose pull

# 3. Restart with the new image
docker compose up -d
```

That's it. Database migrations run automatically on startup. `docker compose up -d`
recreates the container when its image or environment changes; `docker restart`
alone does not apply new environment values.

## What Happens on Startup

1. PostgreSQL starts (embedded in the container)
2. Redis starts (embedded in the container)
3. Database migrations run automatically (Alembic)
4. API server starts
5. If first run and `RCH_SKIP_SEED` is not set → Getting Started demo data is created

## Data Persistence

All data lives in the `rch_data` Docker volume:
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis persistence (RDB snapshots)
- JWT secret key
- PostgreSQL password
- Backup files

As long as you don't delete the volume, your data survives any upgrade.

## Backup Before Upgrade

```bash
# Create backup
docker exec rch /usr/local/bin/backup.sh

# Backups are stored in the volume at /var/lib/rch/backups/
# List backups:
docker exec rch ls -la /var/lib/rch/backups/
```

Backups are auto-pruned after 7 days.

## Restore from Backup

If something goes wrong:

```bash
docker exec rch bash -c 'gunzip -c /var/lib/rch/backups/pg_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql.gz | \
  PGPASSWORD=$(cat /var/lib/rch/.postgres_password) \
  /usr/lib/postgresql/17/bin/psql -h localhost -U rch -d rch'
```

## Pinning a Version

If you want to stay on a specific version instead of `latest`:

```yaml
services:
  rch:
    image: ghcr.io/kwaadx/rch:1.2.0  # pin to specific version
```

## ARM64 (Jetson / Raspberry Pi)

ARM64 is published under a separate tag. Architecture tags may be built and
published at different times, so verify the intended release/digest before
pulling; do not assume `latest-arm64` is synchronized with amd64 `latest`.
Then select the ARM64 tag explicitly:

```yaml
services:
  rch:
    image: ghcr.io/kwaadx/rch:latest-arm64
```

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

## Troubleshooting Upgrades

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Container won't start after upgrade | Check logs: `docker logs rch` — usually a migration issue |
| "relation does not exist" | Migration didn't run — restart the container |
| Lost data after upgrade | You deleted the volume. Restore from backup if available |
| Want to rollback | Stop container, change image tag to previous version, start |
